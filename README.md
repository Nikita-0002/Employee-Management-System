Employee Management System

This project is a backend RESTful API built using Spring Boot, which provides endpoints to manage employee records. It follows a clean layered architecture with controllers, services, and repository layers and utilizes Spring Data JPA for database operations and MySQL as the data store.

The application exposes multiple endpoints to:

Fetch all employee details.

Retrieve a specific employee by ID.

Create a new employee record.

Update an existing employee's details.

Delete an employee by ID.
